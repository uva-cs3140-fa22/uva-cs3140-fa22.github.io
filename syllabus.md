# Resources and Logistics

## Where do I go for help?

* Lecture recordings -> Collab
* Quizzes -> Collab
* Finding a team -> In-class or Piazza
* Concept questions -> Piazza or Office hours
* Coding/debugging help -> Office hours
* Regrades -> Gradescope **only**
* Personal issues -> Email your professor

## Collab

Collab has links to all other course material.

- Links to all other class resources
- Announcements
- Lecture recordings
- Quizzes (only Quizzes - Exams are *in-person* pencil and paper)
- Gradebook (including curved exam scores)

## Course Website

This is the website that you are currently on. Here you can find:

- Syllabus (you're looking at it!)
- Announcements (also posted on Collab via email distribution)
- [Course Schedule](https://uva-cs3140-fa22.github.io/schedule.html) - if the schedule changes this is kept up to date
- Office Hours Schedule (coming soon)

The schedule and assignments information page will include links to 
the drive folder for Lecture Notes, Slides, Assignment Write-ups,
and Submission documents.

## Drive Folder

The student Drive Folder contains:
- All Lecture Notes
  - Slides
  - Readings (including which readings are assigned for each lecture)
  - Example Code
- Up-to-date Course Schedule
- Assignment Information
  - Directions
  - Submission Documents
  - Sample input files

Note that all content in the Drive Folder can be accessed via
the Schedule page on the Course Website. 

## Online Coursepack

Online Coursepack @ [https://sde-coursepack.github.io/](http://sde-course.com/)

There is no official textbook for the course that you need to purchase. Prof. McBurney
is writing an "online textbook" at the URL above, which will generally be written about
~2 weeks ahead of the course.

If you would like to participate, you can clone the repository of the
online textbook and submit pull requests:

[Coursepack Github Repository](https://github.com/sde-coursepack/sde-coursepack.github.io)

All assistance will be credited. I am accepting pull requests for:
- Editing/typo/grammar fixes
- Interesting examples/tutorials
- Additional Source code examples 
- Anything you would like to add to help

All credit for contribution [will be included on this page](https://sde-coursepack.github.io/modules/about/about/)

Assigned Readings for each Lecture are listed and linked in the
lecture notes for that lecture on the Drive Folder. Readings are
strongly encouraged to be completed before class.

Content in the readings that are not covered directly in lecture
are considered "fair game" for exams.

## Gradescope

Every homework assignment will have a document to submit. You will not submit
any code on Gradescope (your code will be on Github). You will only
submit PDF documents.

Exams will be graded on Gradescope.

All regrade requests are handled on Gradescope. Please be aware that
if a regrade request results in a grade change, it can take up to one
week for that change to be reflected on Collab's Gradebook, as syncing
the Gradebook to Gradescope is a very time consuming process, and we will
likely only do it once at the *end* of the regrade request period.

Curved exams scores **will not** appear on Gradescope (Gradescope doesn't
have a feature for this). Curved Exam Scores will be posted on Collab
Usually within 24 hours of Raw Exam Scores being posted on Gradescope.

## Piazza

Piazza @ [https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p](https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p)    

We will be using Piazza for the following:

* Looking for teammates
* Long-form questions about the class, code, or project (please post all code privately!)
* Private messages for faculty or the entire staff
* A searchable repository of common questions in the course about the project, assignments, etc.

We will not be using Piazza for:

* Any code debugging for *any* reason. All questions for help with your specific code must be in office hours only.
* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then professor office hours only if not resolved)

## Email

We will be using email for the following:

* Personal issues that can and should only be handled by a professor

Your Email subject line should start with "[SDE]"

We will not be using email for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope)
* Debugging/Coding help (use Office Hours)
* Installation Help (use Piazza or Office Hours)
* Homework Questions (use Piazza)

12:30 students should email Prof. McBurney, while 
2:00 students should email Prof. Nguyen.  
You do not need to CC the other professor; we will get the other person 
involved if necessary.  

_PLEASE_ make sure to put "[SDE]" at the beginning of the subject line
of all emails!  And please be patient with us in 
responding.  We both receive A LOT of email and it's easy to get behind. 
If there is a time-critical nature to your note, please let us know that 
as well.

Emails will generally be responded to within the next two *business* days
(not including weekends or holidays). If you do not hear back within three
*business* days, please email us again. It's possible your first email was
missed, we forgot to hit *send*, etc. We are human, we will make mistakes
in a class this large.


# Assessment and Grading

Grading in this class will be based one:
* Homework Assignments (7) - 60%  
	* 8% each for Homework 1 through 6
	* 12% for Homework 7
* Quizzes (9) - 5%
	* Must pass at least 8 quizzes for full credit
* Midterms (2) - 20%
	* 10% each
* Cumulative Final Exam (1) - 15%

The class will have one *minor* extra credit opportunity on the final assignment. This
will be a very difficult optional feature to add to the final assignment, and will only
account for ~1.0% of your final grade. There will be no other extra credit opportunities
for any reason.

## Homework Assignments

There will be 7 homeworks assignments. These assignments will be mostly Java programming
assignments. Each assignment is independent, and doesn't require using any code you wrote
from previous assignments. That said, homework assignments may reference previous assignments.

Assignment purpose:
* HW1 - Thinking about design and responding to change (3 people)
  * Note that this assignment will have 3 distinct parts
* HW2 - Testing and clean code 
* HW3 - Refactoring and Java Streams (3 people)
* HW4 - UML Class Diagrams, Three Tier Architecture, Testing with Mockit
* HW5 - JavaFX GUI (3 people)
* HW6 - JSON Parsing and SQL with SQLite (3 people)
* HW7 - Putting it all together (3 people)

On most assignments, you will be given starter code to work with. This starter code
will be automatically added to your teams GitHub Repository when you begin the assignment.

All assignments are intended to take several days to complete. Starting on an assignment late
will not earn any leniency in deadlines, grading, etc. Office Hours will become busier closer
to deadlines, so students should start early.

### Assignment Teams

All assignments are designed to be done collaboratively. Assignments have a cap of 3 people.
Rules on assignment teams:

1. You can only work with a specific person on **4 assignments** or less. You may not work with someone on 5 or more assignments.
2. All team members must join that team's Github repository. All assignment work is committed, shared, and submitted via Github.
3. Everyone on a given team gets the same grade for their assignment, **no exceptions.**
4. Once you have added someone to your team, you cannot remove them **for any reason** for that assignment. 
5. If someone on your team hasn't contributed, you are encouraged to let the professor know, as well as not work with that person in the future.
6. You are welcome to work alone or with a smaller group than suggested. However, the assignment requirements will be the same, regardless of group size. Individual programmers will be held to the same expectations as groups.
7. The instruction staff will not put you on a team, nor will they find a team for you. You are responsible for forming your own teams.

### Advice on Homework

1. It's better to have working code that implements some features than to have non-working code that attempts to implement all features
2. Submissions that cannot be compiled or executed without crashes will not receive partial credit
3. Start early - in a worst case you'll finish early and have more free time.
4. Break the assignment into several individual features. 
   1. Have different people implement each those features in separate classes/files.
   2. Do not have one giant main-class or main-method 
      1. This isn't sustainable for collaborative work
      2. This makes it nearly impossible to test your code effectively
5. Expect to spend at least half of your time testing and debugging
   1. You will whether you plan to or not
6. Commit early and often
   1. Think of committing like "saving" a file. 
   2. You should commit after each "unit of work" (wrote a function, wrote a test, fixed a bug)
   3. You shouldn't need to push after every commit. Push when you've completed a feature!
7. Always work in a branch, not in main.
   1. When you want to add your code to main, merge your branch to main.
8. Never push code directly to main. 
9. When fixing a bug, write a test *first*
   1. The test should fail
   2. The bug is fixed when the test passes
10. Never push code you haven't tested/run
    1. Especially before the deadline!

### Late Policy
 
Most assignments may be submitted up to one week late at a penalty of 7% per 24 hour period. 
(note that this penalty is subtractive, meaning if you score 85%, but it is one day late, 
you will get 78%).
All members of an assignment team will get the same late penalty, 
regardless of contribution (as all members of an assignment team get the 
same grade on the assignment). 

After 7 days, submissions will be accepted at 65% off until December 6th at 11:59 p.m. with
the exception of Homework 7 (see below). Submissions more than one week late may not be 
graded until the end of the term.

Homework 7 will have a separate late policy - no late submissions after 
Friday, December 9th, at 11:59 p.m. for any reason. 
   1. This is in order to ensure:
      1. TAs have time to grade the final assignment
      2. Students have time to study for the final exam
   2. In order to ensure students have time to study for final exams

We will only ever grade your most recent submission. We will not grade multiple submissions and give
you the best score.

Generally, no extension requests will be granted on assignments. This is because each assignment is 
laddered with specific course content. Additionally, new assignments are released when 
the previous assignment is due, and so you should switch to focus on the new assignment.

If there is a serious issue that requires a prolonged absence, you should contact your professor. 
However, because all assignments are team-oriented, and work can be shared remotely over Git, 
extensions are unlikely to be granted for illness.


### Homework collaboration policy

**You should *at no point* see any submitted work (code, question answers, etc.)
from any other team *for any reason*.** This simple rule is the basis of our 
collaboration policy. In this course, you are encouraged to work with 1-2 other people on 
homework assignments. Obviously, you will be sharing code with your teammates 
over Git. *However, you should **at no point share any of your direct work** with anyone
on any other team **for any reason.*** You may not share or publicly post **any homework, quiz, or exam content** in this course.

Only the following people may look at your homework code for any reason:
1. The professors  
2. The TAs  
3. Your team members  

In the case where code is found to have been shared between teams, all teams involved will
be treated as having violated the academic integrity policy. People who shared their code
will receive the same penalty as people who received the code.

Acceptable collaboration between teams is allowed. However, as a general rule, all collaboartion should be "pencils down". That is, if 
you are being so specific in your discussion that you feel you need to write something down, you are probably being too specific. You can,
however, discuss any of the following:
* General algorithms/data structures to use for some part of the function   
* Design strategies for the assignment  
* External libraries you found helpful.  

Submissions in this course will be checked using cheat detection software. If it is found
that you shared code, **intentionally or unintentionally** with any member of another team.

Ignorance of these rules will not be accepted as a defense for violating them.

### Homework external resources policy

**You are allowed and encouraged to use external resources** like StackOverflow, 
Geeksforgeeks, etc. for looking up help with **individual parts** 
of your assignments (such as how to read a JSON file in Java, etc.). Professional
programmers look up syntax, library and class usage examples, etc. all of the time.

However, **you may not copy large portions of external source code** from online. 
If you find you are copying more than 8 lines or so, you should stop. 

**All external references must be cited!**

### How to Cite Code


Use the following format as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for.  Order by title of the software package.  Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code.  Below is a genearl example of a citation format.  Does yours have to look *exactly* like this?  No, nor does it have to have all the fields.  It does have to have enough to give the proper credit and so we can find the resource if needed.

```
//  URL: <where it's located>
//  Description: <what you used, be very specific with line numbers>
```

If you get help from a TA or professor, you must also cite
that in your code.

```
//  Person: Name of TA or professor - you must include a name. "A TA" is not acceptable.
//  Description: <what you got help with, be very specific with line numbers>
```

**Forgetting to cite your code with your sources** is not a defense against an academic
integrity violation, and will not be accepted as such. Ignorance of the rules
will not be accepted as a defense for violating them.

### Homework academic honesty violations

If it is found your submission violates our policies outline above, you will receive the following penalties:

* **1st offense:** 0 on the assignment, plus an additional subtractive deduction to your final course grade up to 10% depending on severity.

* **2nd offense:** F in the course

Depending on severity and at instructor discretion, you may be referred to Honor Committee for any violation, including the first.

## Quizzes

There will be occasional quizzes in the class which are meant to ensure basic understanding of the course lecture material.
Quizzes will be posted on Collab, and are multiple choice. Quizzes are graded in a pass/fail way. Any score >= 80% is considered a
passing score. Any score below 80% is considered a fail. **Quizzes can be taken as many times as needed** to achieve the target score.

You will be able to see your total quiz score after submitting. However, you won't see specifically what you got right/wrong, or the correct
answer until after the quiz closes.

If you pass at least 8 quizzes, you will be given 100% credit for the quiz portion of the grade.

Quizzes are **individual assignments**. Collaboration/working together (even with assignment team members for homeworks) is strictly prohibited.
If collaboration is discovered, it will result in all parties involved receiving a zero on their entire quiz grade for the course.

## Midterms

There will be two non-cumulative midterms during the course.

* Midterm 1: Tuesday, September 27, 2022, in-class
    * Covers all material from start of class up to and including September 22
* Midterm 2: Thursday, November 3, 2022, in-class
    * Covers all material from September 29 up to and including November 1

If you know you will be absent for an exam, you must let your professor know with at least **1-week's notice**. 

## Cumulative Final Exam

The course final exam is cumulative, covering all material from the semester. There will be an emphasis on material covered after Midterm 2, but all content from the course is considered "fair game."

The final exams scheduled for:

* **12:30 p.m. Section (McBurney):** Monday, December 12, 2-5p.m.  
* **02:00 p.m. Section (Nguyen):** Thursday, December 8, 9a.m. to 12 noon

**You must attend the section you are registered for**. If you attend the wrong final exam section, your final exam will be given a zero.

UVA has strict final exam policies. As such, we cannot grant make-ups or alternative exam time without explicitly permission from and notification to a Dean. As such, we will not give a make-up exam for the following under **any circumstances**:

1. Planned Travel (expect to be in Charlottesville during your exam time.  
2. Multiple exams within the same time period - This course is in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. As such, we do not have a "maximum number of exams within a 24-hour period policy". We cannot reschedule exams for this reason with explicit, documented accommodations.  

Any requests for make-ups due to illness must be made through your Dean, and we cannot handle them ourselves.

Exams are **in-person**, closed note, closed book, closed laptop, pencil and paper. Those with extended time or other accommodations should contact your professor to discuss them during the first two weeks of the class.  

### Exam rules

Exams are **in-person**, closed note, closed book, closed laptop, pencil and paper. 
Those with extended time or other accommodations should contact your professor to 
discuss them during the first two weeks of the class.

Make-up exams due to known conflicts must be scheduled **at least one full calendar week in
advance**.

If you are unable to attend an exam

### Exam Curves

The course is intended to have difficult exams *that will be curved*. However, the exact
nature of the curve will be determined after the exam is graded. The curve will not benefit
all students equally. Generally, the curving method used benefit scores closer to the average
more than it will benefit those whose scores are signficantly above or below average.

Scores will never be curved downward. However, not everyone's score is guaranteed to increase
as a result of the curve.

**The purpose of a curve is to adjust exam scores based on the authentic difficulty of the exam.**
The curve does not exist to artificially inflate scores.

The curved scores will be posted on Collab (not Gradescope) usually within 24 hours of the raw
exam scores being posted.

Regrade requests on Exams that result in points changes will be reflected in the curved scores
on Collab. **However, it may take up to one week for curved scores to be updated.**

## Regrade Requests

Regrade Requests can be submitted on Gradescope within one week of an assignment's scores
being posted. Regrade requests cannot be accepted for any reason after the regrade request
deadline.

Regrade requests can result in your entire assignment being regraded. If,
for example, during a regrade request, you find you should have received a deduction
and you mistakenly did not, a regrade request could result in you losing points. We
do not try to find reasons to deduct more points when you submit a regrade request, but
you should be aware of the possibility.

Regrade requests should be written **professionally and respectfully**. Understand that
with a class of several hundred students, there *will* be grading errors. None of the
course staff are trying to make errors, however they will happen. Regrade requests should
explain how you feel the existing rubric was applied wrong in a calm and respectful tone.
Insults, profanity, and unprofessional language will result in a professionalism deduction
to your final course grade, and your regrade request being declined.

Regrade requests are for when **the existing rubric was applied incorrectly**. The following
will be considered frivolous regrade requests:
* Arguing that the rubric should be changed
* Arguing the existing rubric took too many points away
* Arguing for partial credit when your submitted code does not compile or run without crashing
* Asking for additional points to reach a grade threshold

Repeated frivolous regrade request can result:
* All future regrade requests being declined without examination
* A professionalism deduction to your final grade

# Class Management

## Attendance

* No attendance will be taken during the live lectures sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
* In person attendance is required for exams unless you have made other arrangements
* Students are encouraged to attend the section they registered for. However, you may attend the other section's lecture occassionally as needed.
* Lecture sessions recorded and made available through the Lecture Recordings tool in Collab.  
  * However, recordings will not include material written on the board, 
  * Recordings may lose audio when the speaker needs to walk away from the microphone
  * Recordings are not an alternative to attending class, and this class is not meant to be taken remotely

## This Syllabus

{: .no_toc }
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted 
through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be 
changed at any time. Significant changes will be announced. It is up to the student to monitor 
this page and their announcements for any changes. 
Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

## Professionalism

In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning about the development process. A large portion of that process involves interpersonal skills and conflict management. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect.  This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

* Misuse of class platforms (Piazza, Github, etc.)
* Disrespectful language or actions to course staff or other students
* Disrupting lecture or office hours with another student
* Professionally written work. All written answers should be in complete sentences and written for a professional college setting.
* Not participating in work with your partners (such as no commits, missing scheduled meetings, etc.)
* Unauthorized collaborating with other teams

Students can be penalized for unprofessional behavior with deductions to their final grade.
Deductions will be based on the severity and frequency of unprofessional behavior and may
range up to and including an 100% grade deduction in the course in extreme cases.

## Academic Integrity

_Summary_:

* Know the honor code
* Work with your team, but not any other team
* Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation
* Using publicly-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources
* Posting any of yours or a classmate's work from homework, quizzes, or exams publicly anywhere on the internet is an honor violation
  * This includes your public Github Profile, Chegg, StackOverflow, CourseHero, etc. - This is strictly prohibited!
* More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary
* It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community 
of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle 
that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. 
We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that 
has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor w
ill benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering 
School and in the future. 

Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the 
section on academic fraud [http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud](http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). 
Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be 
considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! 
Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have 
neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not 
allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who 
has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student 
or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, 
receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files 
that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for 
those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations 
occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such 
infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is 
appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to 
work with partners on remaining homeworks. 

For CS3140, using code developed by previous students in the course or code written 
for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an 
honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks 
and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.

In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many 
websites and resources for your homeworks.  This is allowed within reason.  
Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source 
(the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed.  Using code snippets 
that you find to round out a feature is allowed **with citation**. 
If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!

In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources within the code where the code or 
algorithm was used  Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in 
a deductions up to 100% on assignments, and be considered an academic integrity
violation in the worst case.

# Miscellaneous Policies
{: .no_toc }

## Inclement Weather Policy
{: .no_toc }
If there is the possibility of inclement weather that could affect class, it is your responsibility to stay informed.  Information about how to sign up for email and/or text alerts from UVA Emergency Management, along with the current University status, can be found at [https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/](https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/).

## SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or [sdac@virginia.edu](mailto:sdac@virginia.edu). If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff).

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the SDAC know you are taking this class.  We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. Please contact us one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.

## Religious Accommodations
{: .no_toc }
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

## Statement on Violence
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:
 
1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence). 
 
As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being 
and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, 
I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy 
and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. 
The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the 
resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented 
to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the 
safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, 
there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See [http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf)). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to 
remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.
