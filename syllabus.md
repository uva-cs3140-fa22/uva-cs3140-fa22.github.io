## Communication and Logistics

### Online Coursepack and YouTube Channel
{: .no_toc }

Online Coursepack @ [https://www.cs3240.org](https://www.cs3240.org)

There is no official textbook for the course that you need to purchase.  We are creating our own online coursepack using the video content we created during COVID, which is available at [https://www.cs3240.org](https://www.cs3240.org).  Note that we are creating this as we go along during the semester, but will do our best to stay ahead of the pace of the class.

You can also subscribe to the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3aJziULnIo&list=PL8KunT5QtGYSsCrQhfIlXXEV_AKKVc6af) so you are always up to date, but we will also post all videos (with some lecture notes) on the coursepack as we build it out.

### Discord
{: .no_toc }

We found Discord worked exceptionally well for all of last year and we plan to incorporate it again, both as a means of communication for staff and teams, but also for general discussion and announcements.  

We will be using Discord for the following:

* Online office hours (professor and TA)
* Online team meetings and discussions
* General project / course discussion
* In-class chat during lectures
* Off-topic channels for general discussion

We will not be using Discord for:

* Long-form project questions / help (use Piazza or go to office hours)
* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Direct messaging the staff about code questions, etc. (use Piazza)
* Direct messaging the faculty about sensitive / grading issues (use Piazza or email)

More information about joining our Discord server will be available in Collab at the start of the semester.

### Piazza
{: .no_toc }

Piazza @ [https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p](https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p)    

Think of Discord as stopping by for a quick chat, for a meeting, or for hanging out, while Piazza is for submitting significant help requests or questions.

We will be using Piazza for the following:

* Long-form questions about the class, code, or project (please post all code privately!)
* Private messages for faculty or the entire staff
* A searchable repository of common questions in the course about the project, assignments, etc.

We will not be using Piazza for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Meme posting (use Discord :-) )

### Email
{: .no_toc }

We will be using email for the following:

* Personal issues that can and should only be handled by a professor
* Team issues that need to be escalated beyond the TA

We will not be using email for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Tech help (use Piazza)
* Project questions (use Piazza)
* Guided Practice questions (use Piazza)

9:30 students should email Sherriff, while 3:30 students should email McBurney.  You do not need to CC the other professor; we will get the other person involved if necessary.  _PLEASE_ make sure to put "CS 3240" in the subject line somewhere so we can keep track of your request!  And please be patient with us in responding.  We both receive A LOT of email and it's easy to get behind.  If there is a time-critical nature to your note, please let us know that as well.

### Who do I ask about...?
{: .no_toc }

* Lecture chat -> Discord
* Team meetings -> Discord
* Online office hours -> Discord
* Technical questions (python, django, heroku, etc.) -> Piazza or TA office hours (NOTE: NOT professor office hours!)
* Project requriements -> Piazza or office hours
* Regrades -> Gradescope (office hours only if issues with Gradescope)
* Personal issues -> Email your professor
* Team issues -> Email your TA and/or your professor

For the context of the project, you should consider the professors "upper management" and the TAs "senior developers / managers."  Thus, high-level, requirements-based, or course-management sort of questions should go to the professors, while all technical and initial grading questions should to go the TAs.  (Honestly, you're probably going to get a faster, better answer to a Django question if you go to the TAs... sure, Prof. Sherriff or McBurney can answer it... eventually... after a lot of Googling... but you could also ask a TA who did the project last semester or has been a TA for several semesters...)

## Course Description
Analyzes modern software engineering practice for multi-person projects; methods for requirements specification, design, implementation, verification, and maintenance of large software systems; advanced software development techniques and large project management approaches; project planning, scheduling, resource management, accounting, configuration control, and documentation. Prerequisite: CS 2150 with a grade of C- or higher.

### Course Objectives
{: .no_toc }   
Upon completion of this course students will:

* Develop an understanding of how to specify, design, and implement a complex software entity that involves many aspects of modern software systems. 
* Master a number of modern tools and a number of difficult technical fields. 
* Acquire experience of working on a large software system as a member of a team working on system development and as a member of a team that has to interact with other teams and customer representatives.

### Course Topics
{: .no_toc }    
The topics to be covered in the course include:  

* Software quality, including testing and inspections
* Project management, scheduling, planning, with an emphasis on the Scrum agile method
* Requirements elicitation, analysis and specification
* Architecture and design principles
* Security in the development of software applications
* Programming and team-based development practices
* Professional ethics

### Course Requirements
{: .no_toc }
You should meet the following requirements to take this class:

1. __Prerequisite: CS 2150 --OR -- CS 3140 with a grade of C- or higher.__  Students that do not meet this prerequisite may be dropped at any point from the class.  It is the student's responsibility to check this prerequisite and/or speak with the instructor ASAP. We’ll assume you have mastered the material in the courses leading up to CS 2150 also, which includes software developments skills in Java and C++.
2. Willing to attend in-person lectures.
3. Participate to the best of your ability in discussions on Piazza and Discord.
4. Be a meaningful contributor to your project team.
5. You will be expected to learn programming languages and platforms on your own in this class! If you don’t feel comfortable with this, please talk to the staff as soon as possible!

## Assessment and Grading
Assessment in this course is different than most courses. As the purpose of this class is for you to gain experience as a software developer working in a team on a larger-scale project, your grade in this course will be based on experience points (XP). Every student begins the course with 0 XP.  As you complete assessments, work on the project, and complete Guided Practice activities, you will earn XP.  Some assessments will have a way to retake or resubmit to earn some of the XP that was not earned on the first attempt.  Please see individual assessments for more information regarding how this mechanic works.

## Class Management

### Project Groups
{: .no_toc }
You are expected to work as a member of your group in this course and cooperate with your colleagues. Cooperation means attending group meetings, completing your assignments properly and on time, letting your group know if you will be out of contact, responding to e-mail from your group, and so on. If there is a lack of cooperation by any group member, it must be brought to the attention of the instructor as soon as it happens. If the lack of cooperation is serious, the offending group member’s semester grade will be lowered.  

### Attendance
{: .no_toc }
* No attendance will be taken during the live lectures sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  
* Students should only attend the lecture section they have registered for, however you are welcome to join either section virtually.  
* Zoom sessions will be recorded and made available through the Online Meetings tool in Collab.  Students are responsible for any material discussed during these sessions.
* Guided Practice activities will take place during announced class sessions.  These can be done together in groups during class time or on your own, depending on what works best for you.  Please note that some Guided Practice activities *must* be done in teams and cannot be done solo or even in pairs.  Pay attention to the instructions each week.

### Late Policy
{: .no_toc }
* Late work grace periods are built into Gradescope where appropriate.  Further exceptions require professor approval.  Some assessments, such as Sprint Checks, have a built-in mechanism by which a team can earn points after a failed submission.

### This Syllabus
{: .no_toc }
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

### Professionalism
{: .no_toc }
In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning about the development process. A large portion of that process involves interpersonal skills and conflict management. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect.  This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

* Misuse of class platforms (Discord, Piazza, YouTube comments, etc.)
* Disrespectful language or actions to course staff or other students
* Promptness for all deadlines and class meetings
* Quality work
* Not working well with your partners
* Collaborating with other teams
* Not following University COVID regulations

Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior.

## Academic Integrity
_Summary_:

* Know the honor code
* Work with your team, but not any other team
* Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation
* Using publically-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources
* More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary
* It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 

Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud [http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud](http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 

For CS3240, using code developed by previous students in the course or code written for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.

In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many different websites and resources for your projects.  This is allowed within reason.  Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source (the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed.  Using code snippts that you find to round out a feature is allowed.  If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!

In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources at the top of the file where the code or algorithm was used AND you should note all sources in your documentation.  Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in a 50% penalty for the project at a minimum.

## How to Cite Code
{: .no_toc }
Use the following format as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for.  Order by title of the software package.  Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code.  Below is a genearl example of a citation format.  Does yours have to look *exactly* like this?  No, nor does it have to have all the fields.  It does have to have enough to give the proper credit and so we can find the resource if needed.

```

## Miscellaneous Policies

### Inclement Weather Policy
{: .no_toc }
If there is the possibility of inclement weather that could affect class, it is your responsibility to stay informed.  Information about how to sign up for email and/or text alerts from UVA Emergency Management, along with the current University status, can be found at [https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/](https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/).

### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or [sdac@virginia.edu](mailto:sdac@virginia.edu). If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff).

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the SDAC know you are taking this class.  We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. Please contact us one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.

### Religious Accommodations
{: .no_toc }
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Statement on Violence
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:
 
1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated. 
2. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
 
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence). 
 
As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See [http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf)). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

__Q: Can we pick our own teams?__   
A: No.  There are solid, pedagogical reasons to have randomly assigned teams.  Also, the purpose of this class is to learn about how to work together with others on a project.  If you are already friends, then that negates that part of the learning objectives.

__Q: Are you adding more students to the course?__    
A: We can handle 250 students max.
